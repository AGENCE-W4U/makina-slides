# What is it about?

Our feelings…

… as developers

… as contributors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why do we contribute?

Explain that to your father-in-law.

# Bottom line

You work for free for people you don't know.

# You are either…

- stupid
- or <s>generous</s> stupid

# It's not about the money

"It's not about the money, money, money

We don't need your money, money, money

We just wanna make the world dance,

Forget about the price tag"

# Why do we work?

- livelihood
- existence
- consistency

# Presenter Notes

- livelihood: we need to eat
- existence: we need to be part of the society
- consistency: we need a shared ideal

# Consistency matters

Only 16% of employees would recommend their company's products.

<strong>That's an epic disaster!!</strong>

# Presenter Notes

ok, that's just in France, and we love to criticize everything: we love to criticize things we don't like, we love to criticize things we like, and we love to criticize things we do not even care about. But still:

# Consistency matters

100% of community members would recommend their product.

# Otium and negotium

Otium = free time, but not just leisure: time for caring

Negotium = the very opposite of otium

# Presenter Notes
negotium => negociate => business => to be busy => not available

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So, business = not caring? really?

Sounds exagerated.

# Example

My customer finds a bug: "Sooooo boring…"

A stranger thinks there is a bug in my last night commit: "I need to fix that ASAP!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A stronger responsibility feeling

Why?

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Minority vs Majority

"Was ist Aufklärung?", Kant

Minor ("Unmündig" also means "dependent" or "unfree") = has no responsibility

Major = autonomous, scholar among scholars

# Developers are grown-ups

The software industry tends to reduce their responsibility.

Communities values their grown-ups status.

# Presenter Notes

they read my code, I read their (developers among developers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Only grown-ups can be parents

Do softwares need parents?

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Writing software is not ordinary production

It is a full creation process managed by the same person (or team).

It is long and iterative.

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This process induces parenthood

We want our code to be better.

We feel proud of it.

We want it to be prepared for the future.

# Presenter Notes

That's the same whatever is your programming level. Mention rapido creation (-3kg) and Plomino (wake me up at night).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Communities are adoption structures

Make sure a software always has loving parents to raise it.

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not just a bunch of developers sharing code

It works like a family: we welcome new members we trust to raise the next generation.

Caring about the software implies we care about the community: we are sharing a common parenthood.

# "I" needs a "We"

"L'individuation psychique et collective", Gilbert Simondon

Becoming myself is a process, which is both **individual** and **collective**.

Belonging to a group makes me feel more as myself.

# Presenter Notes

"I" is just a phase of this process, like a React immutable state :)

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We want to be Plone

The community emanates from the desire of its contributors.

Community > sum(contributors)

# Presenter Notes

this common desire turns the basic existence of the group into an actual consistency of the community

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We, Plone

Transindividuation (Bernard Stiegler)

Plone participates to our "We" and each of our "I" processes.

At the same time, it is also the result of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Two outputs

- Plone-the-thing
- Plone-the-concept

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Plone-the-thing

Just the software itself. Just code.


Plone-the-thing is not perfect.

# Presenter Notes

a tertiary retention

.fx: extra-large

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Plone-the-concept

Plone-the-concept is our **moral ideal**.

It is the community's super-ego ("Über-Ich").

It is (meta-)stable across a collective memory even if contributors change.

# Presenter Notes

Our common knowledge of this code, our memory of its past, the future we imagine create Plone-the-concept. The knowledge of its origin too (Zope), and maybe we have reach the point where we have to kill the father.

# So...

I am not a philosopher nor a psychanalyst.

This talk is potentially a total fraud.

But I can answer one question.

# Presenter Notes

or did I mean a total freud?
